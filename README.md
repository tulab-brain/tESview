1. After downloading tesview.zip, unzip the file and launch MATLAB. Then set MATLAB path. Choose "Add with subfolders. ".
2. Navigate to the tesview directory.
3. Enter "tesview" in the command window to activate the toolbox.
4. Choose a head model depending on your need. Currently, four models are built in the toolbox. To include more age-stratified templates, please download template_HCP.zip for head models of the white and template_CH.zip for models of the Asian, unzip the packages, and copy the template folders to the tesview/template directory.
5. Click "Add an electrode" to add electrodes.
6. Click "Remove an electrode" to remove redundant electrodes.
7. Set position and current strength for each electrode. Note that the summed currents should be zero.
8. Click "OK" to start computing. The settings will be shown in the command window upon confirmation.
9. 1-2 minutes later, windows on the right will show the resulting electric field. Please click on the images to navigate through the volume. Numbers above the windows indicate the coordinates and the intensity value of the selected voxel.
10. Remove all the existing electrodes to activate the edit box "More Electrodes". For montages involving more than six electrodes, please manually input montage settings here and click "OK". Make sure that the inputs follow the format: 'electrode1',intensity1,'electrode2',intensity2,...
